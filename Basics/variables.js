const userId=1
let userName="Prince"
var userPassword="12345"  //never use var keyword because it has issue of block scope
userCity="Siwan"      // we can declare variable like this way also but don't use like this

console.log(userId);    // it is a way of printing 
console.table([userId, userName ,userPassword ,userCity])   //it is a way of printing multiple variable in a table format
